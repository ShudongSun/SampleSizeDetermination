# Introduction

SSD is a simulator that generate different sample size data from pilot data based on multivariate guassian distribution. Then it will calculate the corresponding classification error/ARI/AMI and draw the plot which has the same trend as the true data. People can determine the sample size according the plot we draw.



# Preparations
Before we dive into the main task, we need to load the package and an example dataset for our task.
```{r setup and load data}
library(SSD)

data_pmbc <- read.csv(system.file("extdata", "data_pmbc_24pc.csv", package = "SSD"),row.names=1)
data = data_pmbc
```
